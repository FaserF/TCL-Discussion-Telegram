Legacy or budget models use Android TV.</p> <ul> <li>You can often switch a GTV to \"Apps Only\" mode in settings to get a cleaner, more ATV-like experience.</li> </ul> Why can't my TV see my 5GHz Wi-Fi? <p>TCL TVs often have specific requirements for 5GHz networks:</p> <ol> <li>Lower Channels: Most models only support \"Lower\" 5GHz channels. Set your router to Channels 36, 40, 44, or 48. Higher channels (DFS) are often invisible to the TV.</li> <li>Hardware Support: Some budget/legacy models only support 2.4GHz Wi-Fi. Check your detailed specs or the Telegram group to verify 5G support for your specific ID.</li> </ol> Is my firmware version outdated? <p>Firmware versions are usually in the format <code>VXXX</code> (e.g., <code>V560</code>).</p> <ul> <li>Higher is newer: <code>V560</code> is newer than <code>V509</code>.</li> <li>Prefixes: <code>V</code> = Release, <code>R</code> = Test, <code>M</code> = Pre-production.</li> <li>Identification: See our Firmware Identification Guide to learn how to read your version and platform (including new 2025 formats).</li> <li>Check @FirmwareTCLbot to see the absolute latest official version for your Platform.</li> </ul> My TV is slow. How do I speed it up? <p>Android TVs can become sluggish over time. Try these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Reduce Animations: Go to Developer Options and set all \"Animation scale\" settings to <code>0.5x</code> or <code>Off</code>.</li> <li>Background Process Limit: In Developer Options, set limit to <code>At most 2 processes</code>.</li> <li>Apps Only Mode: (GTV only) Enable this in Accounts/Settings to remove heavy content recommendations.</li> <li>Shop Reset: (Last resort) Use code <code>6425</code> in the Service Menu to perform a clean system wipe. See What is a Shop Reset? for more details.</li> </ol> What is a Shop Reset? <p> A Shop Reset (also known as a Factory Reset via Service Menu) is a deep system wipe that bypasses standard OS limitations.</p> <ul> <li>When to use: If the TV is stuck in \"Shop Mode\", if you encounter persistent bugs after a firmware update, or if a standard Factory Reset fails.</li> <li>How to perform:<ol> <li>Open the Service Menu (Settings &gt; Picture &gt; Brightness &gt; Contrast &gt; <code>6425</code>).</li> <li>Follow our detailed Reset All &amp; Shop Guide for step-by-step instructions and safety tips.</li> </ol> </li> </ul> Where can I find the Play Store? <p>Since Google TV (v11+) prioritizes content, the Play Store icon might be hidden.</p> <ul> <li>Voice Search: Say \"Open Play Store\" to the remote.</li> <li>Settings: Go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; See all apps &gt; Show system apps &gt; Google Play Store &gt; Open.</li> </ul> What are Changelogs/Patch Notes? <p>TCL rarely provides official changelogs for firmware updates. Community members often track changes manually.</p> <ul> <li>Follow the News Channel for major update reports.</li> <li>Check the Firmware History in the bot for version numbers.</li> </ul> What is the Game Bar? <p>The Game Bar is a featureset for 2022+ models (Pentonic/T615) that allows real-time viewing of Refresh Rate (Hz), VRR status, and HDR settings during gaming.</p> <ul> <li>Access: Long-press the Settings (gear) or Menu (three lines) button on the remote while an HDMI source is active.</li> </ul> How do I downgrade my firmware? <p> Downgrading is possible but requires a specific process to avoid bricking your TV.</p> <ul> <li>Requirement: You must use an IMG/PKG file for downgrading (except for specific Realtek models).</li> <li>Data Loss: A downgrade will wipe all your apps and settings.</li> <li>Instructions: Please follow the detailed IMG/PKG Flashing Guide.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"guides/","title":"TCL Firmware Installation Guides","text":"<p>This page details the standard methods for updating and recovering TCL television hardware.</p>"},{"location":"guides/#identify-your-firmware-platform","title":"Identify Your Firmware &amp; Platform","text":"<p>Before downloading any firmware, you must know your TV's Platform and Version.
