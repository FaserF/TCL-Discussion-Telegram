## :material-information-outline: Essential Installation Prep

Flashing a TV is a low-level operation. Precision is required to avoid bricking your hardware.

### Preparation Checklist
*   **USB Drive:** Formatted to **FAT32** (MBR partition table).
*   **Port Selection:** For best stability, use the **USB 2.0** slot (usually white/black). **Note:** T653 firmware may require a **USB 3.0** port.
*   **Source:** Only use files from verified community links or official TCL support.
*   **Environment:** Windows, Linux, or Android can be used to extract or copy files. **Warning for macOS users:** Safari often unzips downloads by default; ensure this is disabled as OTA files must remain zipped.
