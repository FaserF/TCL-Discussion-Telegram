## :material-information-outline: Essential Installation Prep

Flashing a TV is a low-level operation. Precision is required to avoid bricking your hardware.

### Preparation Checklist
*   **USB Drive:** Formatted to **FAT32** (MBR partition table).
*   **Port Selection:** Use the **USB 2.0** slot (usually white/black) for best stability.
*   **Source:** Only use files from verified community links or official TCL support.
*   **Environment:** Use a **Windows PC** to extract or copy files to avoid hidden system metadata files (macOS/Linux) interfering with the bootloader.
