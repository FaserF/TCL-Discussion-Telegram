### :material-help-circle: What we DON'T know
Because we are not TCL employees and do not have access to internal roadmaps, we **cannot** answer the following questions:

1.  **Release Dates:** We do NOT know when new firmware updates will be released.
2.  **Changelogs:** We do NOT have official patch notes. Community reports are our only source of information on changes.
3.  **Bug Fixes:** We do NOT know when specific software errors or hardware bugs will be officially addressed by TCL.
4.  **Major OS Updates:** We do NOT know if or when a specific chipset will receive a major Android/Google TV version update (e.g., from Android 11 to 12).
