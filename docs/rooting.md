# :material-lock-open: Rooting & Custom ROMs

Technical details on modifying the system partition of TCL TVs.

!!! warning "Is Rooting Worth It?"
    For most users, **rooting a TCL Android TV is not worth the risk.**
    Unlike smartphones, TVs don't benefit as much from root, and the risk of a permanent hardware brick is significantly higher. Most "root-only" features (like debloating or custom launchers) can be achieved safely via **ADB**.

### The Challenges of TV Rooting

*   **Closed Bootloaders:** Most TCL models have locked bootloaders that cannot be easily opened.
*   **Platform Specificity:** Root methods are extremely specific to the chipset (SoC) and region.
*   **Loss of Warranty:** Rooting and unlocking will void your warranty.
*   **Broken Features:** Widewine L1 (required for Netflix/Prime 4K) is often lost after rooting.

### Supported Platforms

Currently, only a small subset of Realtek-based platforms have reliable root methods via community-patched images.
