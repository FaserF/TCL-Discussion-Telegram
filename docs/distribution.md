# Content Distribution & Credits

The information, firmware links, and technical guides provided on this hub and our associated Telegram channels are the result of thousands of hours of collective community research.

## :material-shield-key: Redistribution Policy

To maintain the integrity of our support system and ensure users always have access to the most up-to-date and verified information, we enforce the following rules:

### 1. Direct Credits Required
You are **not permitted** to repost firmware links, update files, or technical instructions from our group/channel to other platforms (Telegram, Discord, Forums, or Websites) without:
- **Explicit Links:** You must provide a clear, clickable link back to the original post in our [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/tclupdates) or [Group](https://t.me/tclupdates_discussion).
- **Attribution:** Clearly state that the information was sourced from the **TCL Firmware Discussion Community**.

### 2. No Mirroring
We discourage mirroring our files on third-party cloud storage. Our links are verified and scanned for safety; third-party mirrors cannot be guaranteed by our administration team.

## :material-alert-circle: Unauthorized Redistribution

It has come to our attention that several Telegram groups and channels are currently scraping our content and reposting it as their own.

- **Status:** We have **not granted permission** to these groups.
- **Concern:** Many of these "copy-paste" channels strip away critical safety warnings and chipset identification steps, which leads to users accidentally bricking their televisions.
- **Contact:** If you are an administrator of another group and wish to collaborate or share our content legitimately, please contact a moderator in our main discussion group.

## :material-account-group: Our Community Enthusiasts

This hub exists because of the tireless work of our **Moderators and Admins**. If you find this information useful, please support the original source to ensure we can continue providing free, fast, and safe firmware updates for everyone.
